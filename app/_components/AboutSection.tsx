          Green Country Home Repair LLC was started in Bartlesville in 2015 by brothers Johnny and
          Patrick Bellmyer. With a goal of doing quality home repairs and exceeding customerâ€™s
          expectations our small company has thrived and grown. In 2023, Jose Ojeda joined as a
          partner bringing with him a long history of quality construction and a wealth of knowledge.
